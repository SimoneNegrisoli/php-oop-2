Imagine what classes are necessary to create an online shop with the following characteristics:

E-commerce sells products
Products can have genres or categories
In addition to movies, the products will also include books, games, etc.

We print cards containing the details of the various products, such as image, title, price, etc.
we prepare a page for each type (class of object) and create links in the header to navigate the various sections of the site

**BONUSES:**
Create a stylized navbar header for navigation and add a custom logo
Use the same card template for all products
